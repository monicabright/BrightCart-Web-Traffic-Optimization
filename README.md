# BrightCart-E-Commerce Web-Traffic-Optimization
## Project Background: Bright Cart E-commerce Optimization
### Company: BrightCart Online Retail
### Project Duration: 2nd August 2025 – 26th September 2025
### Tools: Google Sheets, Tableau

BrightCart, a fast-growing online retailer founded in 2010, faced a significant mismatch between traffic growth and revenue generation. Despite a surge in new visitors driven by social media, the company struggled with Traffic Timing Uncertainty and an inability to accurately measure the ROI of various traffic sources (Organic, Paid, Social, Email).
My major task was to identify peak engagement hours and analyze traffic sources to optimize marketing spend and improve conversion efficiency.

## Data Connection & Methodology
To address the Traffic Source Analysis challenge, I connected the dataset directly from Google Sheets to Tableau. The technical workflow focused on creating a robust data model within Tableau to facilitate deep-dive analysis:
- **Table Relationships:** I established a relationship between the User Sessions Table (geography, device, and timestamps) and the Engagement Data Table (traffic sources and conversion outcomes) using a common identifier. This allowed for seamless cross-filtering and granular analysis across the two datasets.
- **KPI Development:** I developed custom Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) within Tableau, including Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rates for new users, conversion efficiency by hour, and average session duration by source.
- **Visual Exploration:** Using the established relationships, I built interactive dashboards to visualize the correlation between traffic timing (temporal patterns) and actual conversion success.

## Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
The analysis reveals a brand with strong organic foundations but a burgeoning social media presence. While Organic Search and Direct sources currently drive the highest volume and conversions, Social Media is the primary growth engine, showing a 77% surge in new user traffic in 2023. A critical "Conversion Timing" mismatch was identified: traffic peaks at 11 PM, while the highest conversion volumes occur in clusters (2 AM, 7 AM, and late afternoon). By correlating these patterns, we identified a 15% potential increase in conversion efficiency through better-timed marketing.

### Insights Deep Dive
**1. Traffic Source ROI & Growth Potential**
- **High-Volume Pillars:** Organic Search and Direct sources consistently lead in both new users and total conversions across 2022, 2023, and 2024.
- **Social Media Growth:** Although total conversions are currently lower than organic, social media showed explosive growth: a 66% increase in 2023 and a further 33% in 2024.
- **Paid Ads Performance:** Paid advertising currently yields the lowest conversions, suggesting a need for a strategic pivot in ad spend.
  
**2. Temporal Traffic Patterns (Peak Engagement)**
- **Weekly Cycle:** Traffic volume builds through the weekend, starting Friday (1,121 views), peaking on Sunday (1,304 views) and Monday (1,236 views), before tapering mid-week.
- **The "11 PM" Phenomenon:** Daily peaks consistently occur at 11 PM, with Sunday averaging 10.75 views and Monday peaking at 11.2 views during this hour.
- **Conversion Clusters:** Highest conversions are recorded at 2 AM, 7 AM, 11 AM, and 12 AM (all averaging 22-23 conversions), with a notable dip at 1 PM (7 conversions).

**3. User Behavior & Device Segmentation**
- **Mobile Dominance:** The majority of users interact via mobile devices, followed by desktop.
- **The Tablet Outlier:** Interestingly, while tablet users are fewer in number, they exhibit the highest average session duration, indicating a highly engaged but underserved segment.
- **Demographics:** Returning and new users are predominantly males from the USA and Canada, with a general decline in the total user base noted in 2024, despite the 52.9% increase in new users.

### Strategic Recommendations
- **Capitalize on Social Growth:** Given the 77% YoY increase in new social users, reallocate budget from underperforming "Paid Ads" to Social Media content and community management.
- **Synchronized Late-Night Campaigns:** Align email blasts and social pushes with the 11 PM peak to ride the Sunday/Monday traffic wave into the high-conversion early morning hours.
- **Tablet Experience Optimization:** Investigate the high session duration of tablet users; optimize the UI for this segment to convert their high engagement into higher sales volume.
- **Retention Strategy for 2024:** Address the decline in returning users seen in 2024 by implementing a loyalty program focused on the primary male demographic in the USA/Canada.

### Achievements & Outcomes
- **15% Increase in Conversion Efficiency:** Identified through the realignment of promotional timing with high-conversion "clusters."
- **Identified 77% Growth Engine:** Pinpointed social media as the most vital channel for future customer acquisition.
- **Operational Accuracy:** Transitioned from "Traffic Timing Uncertainty" to a specific roadmap based on day-of-week and hour-of-day performance metrics.
